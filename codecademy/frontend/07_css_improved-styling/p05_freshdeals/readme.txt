Instructions:
01) Add breadcrumbs in blueberries.html directly above the site hero using an unordered list.
	Make sure to place the text for each trail item within an anchor tag (use "#" as the href attribute).
	Use the following trail for this page:
		Shop
		Groceries
		Blueberries
		Organic

02) Assign the class "breadcrumb" to the unordered list.

03) Next, adjust the CSS in breadcrumb.css so the breadcrumb list elements display inline.

04) Add a character of your choosing with CSS to separate the breadcrumbs. This is typically a > or /.

05) Existing CSS removed the underline and set the hover state for the breadcrumbs. If you’d like to adjust it, you may do so.
	You now have a basic breadcrumb UI!

06) You may have noticed that the existing breadcrumb trail mixes location and attribute breadcrumbs. 
	Specifically, “Organic” is an attribute of these blueberries and we should make it obvious that its an option or filter.
	Add classes to the breadcrumb list elements to designate if they are an "attribute" or a "location".

07) Update the CSS so that there is no longer a breadcrumb denoting symbol between “Blueberries” and “Organic”.

08) Style the attribute breadcrumb to make it obvious that it is an attribute. Try changing the color or setting ::after content to make a “close” notation.
	This will make it obvious to the user that they can interact with it in a different way from the location breadcrumbs.
