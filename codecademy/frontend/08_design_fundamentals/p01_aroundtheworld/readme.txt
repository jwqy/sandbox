Instructions:
01) Before you begin to add colors to the site, you must first choose a color scheme to follow.
	You’ll need to determine your scheme and select a dominant color followed by supporting colors to accent your page design.
	You can use Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/) to help generate color schemes if you want help with inspiration.

02) Once you determine your color scheme, it’s important to update the color of the text across the page to ensure the contrast is well defined.
	Remember to use colors opposite of each other when setting your text color.
	If you have a darker background color, use light-colored text. And vice versa.

03) Using your dominant color from your selected scheme, find and replace the background color of the .photo-hero class.
	Applying this color should help in determining the hierarchy and a focal point for the user when they land on your page.

04) Next, we want to apply some color contrast within the type of the hero section of the website.
	Doing so will help emphasize one single word and add a small hint of color.
	You can do so by replacing the text color of the span nested in the main <h1> tag with the accent color you’ve selected.

05) To help the user navigate through the web page, you can add some separation between sections by applying color backgrounds.
	To do this, change the background color of the blockquote section to that of the accent color you’ve selected or one of your other supporting colors.
	Keep in mind the contrast of the type when applying this background color to ensure the text is legible.

06) Within the blockquote section of your website, let’s update the citation of the testimonial so the text color isn’t as monotonous.
	Find and replace the color of the <footer> text within this section with a tint of your accent color. 
	This will ensure the text is legible while providing some contrast between the quote color and the background itself.

07) Right now, our page is coming together. However, the .photo-about section feels a little bland. 
	While we don’t want to apply a background color as to not overwhelm the user with too many colors in sections,
		we can add some subtle changes to the text to help improve the overall design.
	One of the easiest ways to do this is by changing the color of the <h2> tag to another color within your color scheme.
	Choose a color from your palette and apply it to this element.

08) As you’ve noticed, we developed a pattern for our section backgrounds. 
	Now that we’ve reached the .photo-contact section, it’s time to apply another background color.
	The section above it is white, so this should use one of the colors within your color scheme. 
	Update the background color to one of your colors defined in the color scheme to test and determine if it flows nicely in the design.

09) Our contact section is taking shape now. However, we need to make sure users understand how to use and fill out the form elements within the page.
	The <input> and <textarea> backgrounds can either be white or a darker shade of the background color to ensure the user knows they can select and input their information.
	If you select white as the background color, you will also need to update the color of the text to ensure it is legible as the user begins to fill out the form.
	Be sure to apply the same background color to both the <input> and <textarea> elements to keep all form elements consistent.

10) Now our site is looking great!
	The last part of our website that needs updating is the <footer>.
	We should provide a solid foundation for the bottom of the site, 
		and we can do so by updating the background color while ensuring the color of the type appears readable.
