# TO RUN HTML THAT USES A-Frame LOCALLY #

01) Install “Live Server” extension on VSCode
02) Use VSCode to open your game files
03) Click the “Go Live” button at the bottom of VSCode to start a server on port 5500. 
	This will also prompt your browser to open a new window/tab that loads your index.html file.
04) Make changes to your game files and save the file to automatically refresh your HTML page and see the changes you’ve made.
05) When you’re done with editing your game, click the button that contains the port number of your server (by default it’s 5500) that will shut down the server.
